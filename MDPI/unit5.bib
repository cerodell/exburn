	abstract = {Understanding the combustion dynamics of fuels, and the generation and propagation of smoke in a wildland ﬁre, can inform short-range and long-range pollutant transport models, and help address and mitigate air quality concerns in communities. Smoldering smoke can cause health issues in nearby valley bottoms, and can create hazardous road conditions due to low-visibility. We studied near-ﬁeld smoke dynamics in a prescribed ﬁre of 3.4 hectares of land in a boreal black spruce forest in central Alberta. Smoke generated from the ﬁre was monitored through a network of ﬁve ﬁeld-deployable micro sensor systems. Sensors were placed within 500–1000 m of the ﬁre area at various angles in downwind. Smoke generated from ﬂaming and smoldering combustions showed distinct characteristics. The propagation rates of ﬂaming and smoldering smoke, based on the ﬁne particulate (PM2.5) component, were 0.8 and 0.2 m/s, respectively. The ﬂaming smoke was characterized by sharp rise of PM2.5 in air with concentrations of up to 940 µg/m3, followed by an exponential decay with a half-life of {\textasciitilde}10 min. Smoldering combustion related smoke contributed to PM2.5 concentrations above 1000 µg/m3 with slower decay half-life of {\textasciitilde}18 min. PM2.5 emissions from the burn area during ﬂaming and smoldering phases, integrated over the combustion duration of 2.5 h, were {\textasciitilde}15 and {\textasciitilde}16 kilograms, respectively, as estimated by our mass balance model.},

	abstract = {A 3.6 ha experimental ﬁre was conducted in a black spruce peatland forest that had undergone thinning the year prior. After 50 m of spread in a natural stand at 35–60 m min−1, the crown ﬁre (43,000 kW m−1 intensity using Byram’s method) encountered the 50\% stem removal treatment; spread rates in the treatment were 50–60 m min−1. Fuel consumption in the control (2.75 kg m−2) was comparable to the treatment (2.35 kg m−2). Proxy measurements of ﬁre intensity using in-stand heat ﬂux sensors as well as photogrammetric ﬂame heights had detected intensity reductions to 30–40\% of the control. Crown fuel load reductions (compensated by higher surface fuel load) appear to be the most signiﬁcant contributor to the decline in intensity, despite drier surface fuels in the treatment. The burn depth of 5 cm in moss and organic soil did not diﬀer between control and treatment. These observations point to the limited eﬀectiveness (likely reductions in crown ﬁre intensity but not spread rate) of stem removal in boreal black spruce fuel types with high stem density, low crown base height and high surface fuel load. The observed ﬁre behaviour impacts diﬀer from drier conifer forests across North America.},

The amount of smoke injected vs. height is a key input into chemical transport models and smoke modelling frameworks. Due to scarcity of model evaluation data as well as the inherent complexity of wildﬁre plume dynamics, smoke injection height predictions have large uncertainties. In this work we use the coupled ﬁre–atmosphere model WRFSFIRE conﬁgured in large-eddy simulation (LES) mode to develop a synthetic plume dataset. Using this numerical data, we demonstrate that crosswind integrated smoke injection height for a ﬁre of arbitrary shape and intensity can be modelled with a simple energy balance. We introduce two forms of updraft velocity scales that exhibit a linear dimensionless relationship with the plume vertical penetration distance through daytime convective boundary layers. Lastly, we use LES and prescribed burn data to constrain and evaluate the model. Our results suggest that the proposed simple parameterization of mean plume rise as a function of vertical velocity scale offers reasonable accuracy (30 m errors) at little computational cost.},

WRF-Sfire directly predicts wildfire spread, plume and plume-top heights, providing comprehensive meteorology and fire emissions to chemical transport model WRF-Chem, eliminating the need for an external plume-rise model. Evaluation of WRFSC was based on comparisons between available observations of fire perimeter and fire intensity, smoke spread, PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 mm in diameter), NO and ozone concentrations, and plume-top heights with the results of two WRFSC simulations, a 48-h simulation of the 2007 Witch–Guejito Santa Ana fires and a 96-h WRF-Sfire simulation with passive tracers of the 2012 Barker Canyon fire. The study found overall good agreement between forecast and observed local- and long-range fire spread and smoke transport for the Witch–Guejito fire. However, ozone, PM2.5 and NO concentrations were generally underestimated and peaks mistimed in the simulations. This study found overall good agreement between simulated and observed plume-top heights, with slight underestimation by the simulations. Two promising results were the agreement between plume-top heights for the Barker Canyon fire and faster than real-time execution, making WRFSC a possible operational tool.},

The experimental design was guided by the use of a coupled fire–atmosphere model that predicted the fire spread in advance. Preliminary results show that after ignition, a surface pressure perturbation formed and strengthened as the fire front and plume developed, causing an increase in wind velocity at the fire front. The fire-induced winds advected hot combustion gases forward and downwind of the fire front that resulted in acceleration of air through the flame front. Overall, the experiment collected a large set of micrometeorological, air chemistry and fire behaviour data that may provide a comprehensive dataset for evaluating and testing coupled fire–atmosphere model systems.},

Based on an analysis of these numerical simulations, this paper provides recommendations on the experimental setup such as size and duration of the burns, and optimal sensor placement. New techniques are developed to initialize coupled fire-atmosphere simulations with weather conditions typical of the planned burn locations and times. The variation and sensitivity analysis of the simulation design to model parameters performed by repeated Latin Hypercube Sampling is used to assess the locations of the sensors. The simulations provide the locations for the measurements that maximize the expected variation of the sensor outputs with varying the model parameters.},

	abstract = {During the summer of 2015, a number of large wildﬁres burned across Northern California in areas of localized topographic relief. Persistent valley smoke hindered ﬁre‐ﬁghting efforts, delayed helicopter operations, and exposed communities to extreme concentrations of particulate matter. It was hypothesized that smoke from the wildﬁres reduced the amount of incoming solar radiation reaching the ground, which resulted in near‐surface cooling, while smoke aerosols resulted in warming aloft. As a result of increased inversion‐like conditions, smoke from wildﬁres was trapped within mountain valleys adjacent to active wildﬁres. In this study, wildﬁre smoke‐induced inversion episodes across Northern California were examined using a modeling framework that couples an atmospheric, chemical, and ﬁre spread model. Modeling results examined in this study indicate that wildﬁre smoke reduced incoming solar radiation during the afternoon, which lead to local surface cooling by up to 3 °C, which agrees with cooling observed at nearby surface stations. Direct heating from the ﬁre itself did not signiﬁcantly enhance atmospheric stability.},

Wildland ﬁres dynamically interact with the atmosphere, which can impact ﬁre behavior, plume rises, and smoke dispersion. For understory ﬁres, the ﬁre propagation is driven by winds attenuated by the forest canopy. However, most numerical weather prediction models providing meteorological forcing for ﬁre models are unable to resolve canopy winds. In this study, an improved canopy model parameterization was implemented within a coupled ﬁre-atmosphere model (WRF-SFIRE) to simulate a prescribed burn within a forested plot. Simulations with and without a canopy wind model were generated to determine the sensitivity of ﬁre growth, plume rise, and smoke dispersion to canopy eﬀects on near-surface wind ﬂow. Results presented here found strong linkages between the simulated ﬁre rate of spread, heat release and smoke plume evolution. The standard WRF-SFIRE conﬁguration, which uses a logarithmic interpolation to estimate sub-canopy winds, overestimated wind speeds (by a factor 2), ﬁre growth rates and plume rise heights. WRF-SFIRE simulations that implemented a canopy model based on a non-dimensional wind proﬁle, saw signiﬁcant improvements in sub-canopy winds, ﬁre growth rates and smoke dispersion when evaluated with observations.},

	abstract = {One of the primary challenges associated with evaluating smoke models is the availability of observations. The limited density of traditional air quality monitoring networks makes evaluating wildﬁre smoke transport challenging, particularly over regions where smoke plumes exhibit signiﬁcant spatiotemporal variability. In this study, we analyzed smoke dispersion for the 2018 Pole Creek and Bald Mountain Fires, which were located in central Utah. Smoke simulations were generated using a coupled ﬁre‐atmosphere model, which simultaneously renders ﬁre growth, ﬁre emissions, plume rise, smoke dispersion, and ﬁre‐atmosphere interactions. Smoke simulations were evaluated using PM2.5 observations from publicly accessible ﬁxed sites and a semicontinuously running mobile platform. Calibrated measurements of PM2.5 made by low‐cost sensors from the Air Quality and yoU (AQ\&U) network were within 10\% of values reported at nearby air quality sites that used Federal Equivalent Methods. Furthermore, results from this study show that low‐cost sensor networks and mobile measurements are useful for characterizing smoke plumes while also serving as an invaluable data set for evaluating smoke transport models. Finally, coupled ﬁre‐atmosphere model simulations were able to capture the spatiotemporal variability of wildﬁre smoke in complex terrain for an isolated smoke event caused by local ﬁres. Results here suggest that resolving local drainage ﬂow could be critical for simulating smoke transport in regions of signiﬁcant topographic relief.},

	abstract = {A newer generation of models that interactively couple the atmosphere with fire behavior have shown an increased potential to understand and predict complex, rapidly changing fire behavior. This is possible if they capture intricate, time-varying microscale airflows in mountainous terrain and fire-atmosphere feedbacks. However, this benefit is counterbalanced by additional limitations and requirements, many arising from the atmospheric model upon which they are built. The degree to which their potential is realized depends on how coupled models are built, configured, and applied. Because these are freely available to users with widely ranging backgrounds, I present some limitations and requirements that must be understood and addressed to achieve meaningful fire behavior simulation results. These include how numerical weather prediction models are formulated for specific scales, their solution methods and numerical approximations, optimal model configurations for common scenarios, and how these factors impact reproduction of fire events and phenomena. I discuss methods used to adjust inadequate outcomes and advise on critical interpretation of fire modeling results, such as where errors from model limitations may be misinterpreted as natural unpredictability. I discuss impacts on other weather model-based applications that affect understanding of fire behavior and effects.},

The simulation by WRF-SFIRE of the experimental burn shows that WRF-SFIRE is capable of providing realistic head-ﬁre rate of spread and vertical temperature structure of the ﬁre plume, and ﬁre-induced surface ﬂow and vertical velocities within the plume up to 10 m above ground level. The simulation captured the changes in wind speed and direction before, during, and after ﬁre front passage, along with the arrival times of wind speed, temperature, and updraft maxima, at the two instrumented ﬂux towers used in FireFlux. The model overestimated vertical wind speeds and underestimated horizontal wind speeds measured at tower heights above 10 m. It is hypothesized that the limited model spatial resolution led to overestimates of the ﬁre front depth, heat release rate, and updraft speed. However, on the whole, WRF-SFIRE simulated ﬁre plume behavior that is consistent with FireFlux observations. The study suggests optimal experimental pre-planning, design, and execution strategies for future ﬁeld campaigns that are intended to evaluate and develop further coupled atmosphere–ﬁre models.},

WRF–SFIRE consists of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the ﬁre-spread model SFIRE. This paper presents new developments, which were introduced as a response to the needs of the community interested in operational testing of WRF–SFIRE. These developments include a fuel-moisture model and a fuel-moisture-data-assimilation system based on the Remote Automated Weather Stations (RAWS) observations, allowing for ﬁre simulations across landscapes and time scales of varying fuel-moisture conditions. The paper also describes the implementation of a coupling with the atmospheric chemistry and aerosol schemes in WRF–Chem, which allows for a simulation of smoke dispersion and effects of ﬁres on air quality. There is also a data-assimilation method, which provides the capability of starting the ﬁre simulations from an observed ﬁre perimeter, instead of an ignition point. Finally, an example of operational deployment in Israel, utilizing some of the new visualization and datamanagement tools, is presented.},

	abstract = {Vorticity-driven lateral ﬁre spread (VLS) is a form of dynamic ﬁre behaviour, during which a wildland ﬁre spreads rapidly across a steep leeward slope in a direction approximately transverse to the background winds. VLS is often accompanied by a downwind extension of the active ﬂaming region and intense pyro-convection. In this study, the WRF-Fire (WRF stands for Weather Research and Forecasting) coupled atmosphere–ﬁre model is used to examine the sensitivity of resolving VLS to both the horizontal and vertical grid spacing, and the ﬁre-to-atmosphere coupling from within the model framework. The atmospheric horizontal and vertical grid spacing are varied between 25 and 90 m, and the ﬁre-to-atmosphere coupling is either enabled or disabled. At high spatial resolutions, the inclusion of ﬁre-to-atmosphere coupling increases the upslope and lateral rate of spread by factors of up to 2.7 and 9.5, respectively. This increase in the upslope and lateral rate of spread diminishes at coarser spatial resolutions, and VLS is not modelled for a horizontal and vertical grid spacing of 90 m. The lateral ﬁre spread is driven by ﬁre whirls formed due to an interaction between the background winds and the vertical circulation generated at the ﬂank of the ﬁre front as part of the pyro-convective updraft. The laterally advancing ﬁre fronts become the dominant contributors to the extreme pyro-convection. The results presented in this study demonstrate that both high spatial resolution and two-way atmosphere–ﬁre coupling are required to model VLS with WRF-Fire.},

This is achieved through a series of idealized numerical simulations performed with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and WRF-Fire coupled atmosphere-ﬁre models. The sensitivity of the atypical lateral ﬁre spread across lee slopes is tested for a varying background wind speed, wind direction relative to the terrain aspect, and lee slope steepness. The results indicate that the lateral spread characteristics are highly sensitive to each of these environmental conditions, and there is a broad agreement with the empirical thresholds calculated for lateral spread events observed in the 2003 Canberra bushﬁres. A theory to explain these environmental thresholds and their apparent interdependency is presented. The results are expected to have important implications for the management of wildland ﬁres in rugged terrain.},

	abstract = {The level-set method is typically used to track and propagate the ﬁre perimeter in wildland ﬁre models. Herein, a high-order level-set method using ﬁfth-order WENO scheme for the discretization of spatial derivatives and third-order explicit Runge-Kutta temporal integration is implemented within the Weather Research and Forecasting model wildland ﬁre physics package, WRF-Fire. The algorithm includes solution of an additional partial differential equation for level-set reinitialization. The accuracy of the ﬁrefront shape and rate of spread in uncoupled simulations is systematically analyzed. It is demonstrated that the common implementation used by level-set-based wildﬁre models yields to rate-of-spread errors in the range 10–35\% for typical grid sizes (D 5 12.5–100 m) and considerably underestimates ﬁre area. Moreover, the amplitude of ﬁre-front gradients in the presence of explicitly resolved turbulence features is systematically underestimated. In contrast, the new WRF-Fire algorithm results in rate-of-spread errors that are lower than 1\% and that become nearly grid independent. Also, the underestimation of ﬁre area at the sharp transition between the ﬁre front and the lateral ﬂanks is found to be reduced by a factor of \%7. A hybrid-order level-set method with locally reduced artiﬁcial viscosity is proposed, which substantially alleviates the computational cost associated with high-order discretizations while preserving accuracy. Simulations of the Last Chance wildﬁre demonstrate additional beneﬁts of high-order accurate level-set algorithms when dealing with complex fuel heterogeneities, enabling propagation across narrow fuel gaps and more accurate ﬁre backing over the lee side of no fuel clusters.},

An online database, the Smoke Emissions Repository Application (SERA), was created to enable analysis and summaries of existing EFs to be used in smoke management and emissions inventories. We evaluated how EFs of select pollutants (CO, CO2, CH4, NOx, total particulate matter (PM), PM2.5 and SO2) are influenced by combustion phase, burn type and fuel type. Of the 12 533 records in the database, over a third (n ¼ 5637) are represented by 23 air pollutants, most designated as US Environmental Protection Agency criteria air pollutants, greenhouse gases, hazardous air pollutants or known air toxins. Among all pollutants in the database, including the most common pollutants PM, CO, CO2 and CH4, records are unevenly distributed with a bias towards flaming combustion, prescribed burning and laboratory measurements. Across all EFs, records are most common for south-eastern and western conifer forests and western shrubland types. Based on identified data gaps, we offer recommendations for future studies, including targeting underrepresented air pollutants, smouldering combustion phases and improved source characterisation of wildland fire emissions.},
